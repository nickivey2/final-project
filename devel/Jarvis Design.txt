Jarvis Design 


Using the speech recognition python module, Jarvis will listen for his defined pharses and respond using either osx's terminal "say" command or pyttsx module in windows.

The program has a logger implemented for easy debugging
 
run.py loops listening for a valid string recognized by speech recognition and then sends it to the handler function in the Jarvis.py class. 

Jarvis.py then checks if the speech recognized has any meaning to jarvis.

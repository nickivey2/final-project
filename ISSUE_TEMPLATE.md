Nick Ivey Jarvis Final Project

### Name
Nicholas Ivey 

### Proposed Project Description
I am going to port my Jarvis Personal Assistant I created in C# prior to this class to Python.

Old Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fyzdf_DOE0
Porting Jarvis to Python will allow me to run Jarvis on my Raspberry Pi instead of a Windows Machine. Using Google Voice Recognition, Jarvis will tell you the day of the week, time, and the weather. Also Jarvis will be able to perform google searches and control system volume.

### Connecting Concepts
